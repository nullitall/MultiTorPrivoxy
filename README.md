Example: ./privoxtor.sh 5 192.168.1.2

Make sure Tor and Privoxy are installed to the machine, to kill all processes run "killall -v tor privoxy", then delete both data and privoxy folder that were created wfrom the original directory you run the shell script from "rm -rf data privoxy", easy peasy.
